## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df=
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
            sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel",
            range=cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
drop_na(dumpster) %>%
mutate(
  sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
  sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

Read the precipitation data for 2017 and 2018.

``` r
precip_2017 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
drop_na(month) %>%
mutate(year = 2017) %>%
relocate(year)

precip_2018 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
drop_na(month) %>%
mutate(year = 2018) %>%
relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018) %>%
mutate(month = month.name[month])
precip_df
```

Data description:

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. When trash enters the inner harbor,
the trashwheel collects the trash and stores it in a dumpster. The
dataset contains information on year, month, and the amount and types of
trash collected. There are 344 observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel
sheet. Key variables include month, year, the weight of dumpster in
tons, and the amount of some specific types of trash such as plastic
bottles and sports balls. There are 24 observations in the precipitation
dataset. Key variables include year, month, and precipitation. From
available data, the total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33, and the
median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the data.

``` r
station_df =
  read_csv(file="./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
select(line:route11,entry,vending,entrance_type,ada) %>%
mutate(entry=recode(entry,"YES"=TRUE,"NO"=FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Data description: The dataset contains line, station\_name, station
latitude and longtitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type,
and ADA compliance. So far I imported the datafile, transformed all of
the variable names to lowercase letters, selected relevant variables,
and mutated character values in the entry variable to logical values.
The dataset contains 1868 rows and 19 columns. The dataset is not tidy
since columns from route1 to route11 are not variables but values.

Problem 2 a)

There are 465 distinct stations here in NYC.

Problem 2 b)

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

Problem 2 c)

The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance
is 0.3770492.

Reformat data.

``` r
station_df_char = 
  mutate(station_df, route8 = as.character(route8),  route9 = as.character(route9), route10 = as.character(route10), route11 = as.character(route11))
station_df_tidy = 
  pivot_longer(
    station_df_char,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route_name"
  ) %>%
  drop_na()
```

Calculate the number of distinct stations serving the A train.

``` r
a_disstation = distinct(select(station_df_tidy,station_name,line,route_name,ada)) %>%
  filter(route_name=="A")
```

There are 60 distinct stations serving the A train.

Of those stations that serve A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

First, read and clean pols-month.

``` r
polsmonth_df=
  read_csv(file ="./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  separate(mon,c("year","month","day")) %>%
  mutate(year =
           as.integer(year),
         month=month.name[as.integer(month)],
         day = as.integer(day),
         president = case_when(
           prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
           prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem")) %>%
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Second, read and clean snp.csv.

``` r
snp_df=
  read_csv(file ="./data/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  separate(date,c("month","day","year")) %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = month.name[as.integer(month)],
    day = as.integer(day)) %>%
relocate(year, month) %>%
arrange(year, month) %>%
select(-day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Third, tidy the unemployment data.

``` r
unemployment_df=
  read_csv(file ="./data/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na()
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
unemployment_tidy_df = 
  pivot_longer(
    unemployment_df,
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "percentage")
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = c("jan","feb","mar","apr","may","jun","jul","aug","sep","oct","nov","dec"),
    month_name = month.name
  )
unemployment_tidy_month_df = 
  left_join(unemployment_tidy_df,month_df,by = "month") %>%
  select(-month) %>%
  relocate(year,month_name) %>%
  select(year,month=month_name,percentage)
```

Merge snp into pols, and merge unemployment.

``` r
pols_snp = 
  left_join(polsmonth_df,snp_df,by = c("year"="year","month"="month"))
pols_snp_unem =
  left_join(pols_snp,unemployment_tidy_month_df,by = c("year"="year","month"="month"))
```

Describe each dataset: The dataset polsmonth\_df contains 822
observations of 9 variables related to the number of national
politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time, such as
the number of governors/senators/representatives of a certain political
party. The range of years is 1947 and 2015.

The dataset snp\_df contains 787 observations of 3 variables related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index, including year, month, and close
(the closing values of the S\&P stock index). The range of years is 1950
and 2015.

The dataset unemployment\_tidy\_month\_df contains 804 observations of 3
variables, including year, month, and the percentage of unemployment at
a certain time. The range of years is 1948 and 2014.
